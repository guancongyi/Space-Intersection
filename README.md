# Space_Intersection

* A C++ program for extracting high resolution images' feature points and conver them to latitude and longitude by using space-intersection. 

* Be able to get high accuracy feature point pairs by extracting ORB feature points, matching them, and eliminating incorrect feature points by applying RANSAC algorithm.

* Used Nividia CUDA support for better performance during the process of feature points extraction and matching.
